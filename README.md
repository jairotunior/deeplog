DeepLog is an open source Python framework for building, testing, training, evaluating, and deploying robust inventory models using reinforcement learning.
This framework aims to extend the existing ML pipelines created by `pandas`, `gym`, `sklearn`, `keras`, and `tensorflow` in a simple, intuitive way.

Allow state-of-the-art learning agents to improve your trading strategies and take you from idea to production, in a repeatable, maintable way.

A supply and replenishment system implemented like an environment in gym. The library let you develop supply models and applied Reinforcement learning in Gym Toolkit. You could apply differents state of the art algorithm in Deep Reinforcement Learning.

The Goal of the proyect is create an agent that have the ability of manage a supply system.

_The goal of this framework is to enable fast experimentation.

Read [the documentation](https://www.algo.com).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Installing

1. Create a new virtual environment with your prefered tools
2. Copy the repositiory https://github.com/jairotunior/gym_supply.git
3. Install the dependencies

```sh
pip install -r requeriments.txt
```

That's all for use.
