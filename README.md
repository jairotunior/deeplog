# Supply and Replenishment System Gym Environment

A supply and replenishment system implemented like an environment in gym. The library let you develop supply models and applied Reinforcement learning in Gym Toolkit. You could apply differents state of the art algorithm in Deep Reinforcement Learning.
The Goal of the proyect is create an agent that have the ability of manage a supply system.
